# Elm-Smart-Bulb

Initial PoC of controlling a [Smart Bluetooth Bulb](https://medium.com/@urish/reverse-engineering-a-bluetooth-lightbulb-56580fcb7546) from Elm code using Web Bluetooth.

## Running

Run in elm reactor:

    elm reactor

Then go to http://localhost:8000/src/index.html

If you do not have a Magicblue Smart bulb, but have a recent Android phone, you can try your luck with my [Bluetooth Bulb Simulator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.urish.bulbsimulator&hl=en).
